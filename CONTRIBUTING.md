   git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
   ```

4. **Push and Create PR**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Create PR via GitHub web interface
   ```

### Testing

#### Local Testing
```bash
# Start the stack
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are healthy
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
curl http://localhost:8091/metrics

# Check dashboard loads
curl -I http://localhost:3000
```

#### Dashboard Testing
- Test all panels display data correctly
- Verify responsiveness on different screen sizes
- Ensure proper error handling for missing data
- Test auto-refresh functionality

### Documentation

#### README Updates
- Update feature lists for new functionality
- Add configuration examples
- Include troubleshooting steps for new components

#### Code Documentation
```python
def generate_mock_metrics(self) -> str:
    """
    Generate mock Freqtrade metrics in Prometheus format.
    
    Returns:
        str: Prometheus-formatted metrics string with randomized values
    """
